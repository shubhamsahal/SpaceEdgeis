Effective Date: September 2025

Overview
SpaceEdge is a secure, free file storage and sharing service built with privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it's used, and your rights relating to your information when you use our site.

What Information Do We Collect?
Google Account Data: When logging in with Google OAuth2, only your email address and basic Google profile information (needed for authentication) are collected.

Files You Upload: Files and metadata (filename, size, upload date) you upload are stored securely on Microsoft Azure cloud storage. Your files remain private unless you choose to share them.

Usage Data: We collect minimal, anonymous data on storage usage and basic error logs to improve site reliability. No tracking or marketing cookies are used.

How Do We Use Your Data?

To store your uploaded files and display them in your account dashboard.

To enable file sharing when you generate a public share link.

To maintain and improve our service never for advertising or sales.

Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or rent your data to anyone.

Your files are private by default and are never shared unless you explicitly use the sharing feature and send a public link.

Data may be disclosed if required by law (e.g., to comply with a legal obligation).

Data Security
All files and user data are stored with strong encryption in Microsoft Azure.

We follow best practices for secure authentication and data access.
